## The Autonomous and Assistive Robotics A2R Research Lab
is dedicated to the development of intelligent robotic systems
that enhance human capabilities and enable autonomous operation in dynamic environments, as well as the development
of biomechatronic assistive systems, such as rehabilitation and prosthetic systems. A2R research focuses primarily on:
- **Autonomous Systems**: Developing self-driving vehicles, robotic navigation, and artificial intelligence-driven decision-
making for safe and adaptive autonomy in complex technical and social environments.
- **Swarm Robotics & Multi-Agent Systems**: Development of biologically inspired fleet intelligence, decentralized
coordination, and collaborative robot teams, including drone swarms and autonomous mobile units for real-world
applications.
- **Assistive Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Design of bionic prostheses, rehabilitation devices, and
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to improve mobility, interaction, and quality of life.
